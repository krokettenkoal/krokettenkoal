### Hi there 👋
I love creating applications and libraries with a strong attention to usability and UX. 
When I'm not doing stuff for university (studying and teaching some courses), I'm usually working on some games or web projects.

Currently, I'm mainly working on:
* 🧑‍💻 My university's [equipment rental system](https://verleih.fhstp.ac.at) and [my team's homebase site](https://labs.fhstp.ac.at/) for **work**
* 🎓 A VR adventure game project for my **master studies**
* 😴 Various web and game stuff in my currently very limited free time

**Some of my favorite technologies, tools & frameworks:**
* Svelte(Kit)
* Node.js/npm
* Unity
* Wwise
* Git
* C#
* TypeScript
* JetBrains IDEs 🙂
* ...

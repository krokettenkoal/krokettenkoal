### Hi there 👋
I love creating applications and libraries with a strong attention to usability and UI/UX.
When I'm not doing stuff for university (studying and teaching some courses), I'm usually working on some games or web projects.

Currently, I'm mainly working on:
* 🧑‍💻 Reworks of my university's [equipment rental system](https://verleih.fhstp.ac.at) and [my team's homebase site](https://labs.fhstp.ac.at/) for **work**
* 🎓 A thesis on gesture-based NPC dialogue interfaces in VR RPGs for my **master's thesis**
* 🛝 A web app for downloading audio/video from streaming platforms for **fun**

**Some of my favorite technologies, tools & frameworks:**
* Svelte(Kit), Node.js, [shadcn-svelte](https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte)
* Unity, Wwise
* TypeScript, C#
* JetBrains IDEs 🙂
* ...

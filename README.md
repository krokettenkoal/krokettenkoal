### Hi there 👋
I love creating applications and libraries with a strong attention to usability and UX. 
When I'm not doing stuff for university (studying and teaching various software development courses), I'm usually working on some games or web projects.

Currently, I'm mainly working on:
* 🧑‍💻 My university's [equipment rental system](https://verleih.fhstp.ac.at) (complete rewrite) for **work**
* 🎓 An interactive VR Escape Room for my **master studies**
* 🚗 A toolbox for importing Need for Speed game assets into Unity for **fun***

**Some of my favorite technologies, tools & frameworks:**
* Svelte(Kit)
* Node.js/npm
* Unity
* Wwise
* Git
* C#
* TypeScript
* JetBrains IDEs 🙂
* ...
